    <h1>I have a Dream</h1><br>
    <p>The “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr
        . before a crowd of some 250,000 people at the 1963 March on Washington,
         remains one of the most famous speeches in history.
         Weaving in references to the country’s Founding Fathers and the Bible, 
         King used universal themes to depict the struggles of African Americans
          before closing with an improvised riff on his dreams of equality.
           The eloquent speech was immediately recognized as a highlight of the successful protest,
        has endured as one of the signature moments of the civil right
         movement.</p>
